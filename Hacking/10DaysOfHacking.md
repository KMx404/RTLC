Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose. ... White hat professionals hack to check their own security systems to make it more hack-proof.

<b><i>:zap: Hacker:</i></b> <br />

In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. There are communities and shared cultures of expert programmers and networking wizards that trace its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture were the first "hackers." Breaking into computers and phone systems have come to symbolize hacking in popular culture, but this culture is much more complicated and moralistic than most people know. To become a hacker, learning basic hacking techniques, how to think like a hacker, and how to gain respect within the ethical hacking community.

## What do i need to learn & know??: <br />

1. <b><i>:computer: Basic Computer Skills:</i></b> <br />

It probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some basic computer skills. These skills go beyond the ability to create a Word document or cruise the Internet. You need to be able to use the command line in Windows, edit the registry, and set up your networking parameters. <br />

Many of these basic skills can be acquired in a basic computer skills course like A+. <br />

2. <b><i>:satellite: Networking Skills:</i></b> <br />
You need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following. <br />

- DHCP <br />
- NAT <br />
- Subnetting <br />
- IPv4 <br />
- IPv6 <br />
- Public v Private IP <br />
- DNS <br />
- Routers and switches <br />
- VLANs <br />
- OSI model <br />
- MAC addressing<br />
- ARP <br />

As we are often exploiting these technologies, the better you understand how they work, the more successful you will be. Note that I did not write the two guides below, but they are very informative and cover some of the networking basics mentioned above. <br />
