You will find a bunch of informations & things to learn from. Try to read/watch! Be curious. <br />
<b> <i> One thing to put in mind! </i> </b>: <br />
- There's no ultimate map or road to follow. A lot of Hackers started from different Points and went through different road to get 
to one Goal which is Becoming a <i>Hacker.</i> <br /> <br />

## What is hacking? Who is a hacker?: <br />
<b><i>:zap: Hacking:</i></b> <br />

Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose. ... White hat professionals hack to check their own security systems to make it more hack-proof.

<b><i>:zap: Hacker:</i></b> <br />

In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. There are communities and shared cultures of expert programmers and networking wizards that trace its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture were the first "hackers." Breaking into computers and phone systems have come to symbolize hacking in popular culture, but this culture is much more complicated and moralistic than most people know. To become a hacker, learning basic hacking techniques, how to think like a hacker, and how to gain respect within the ethical hacking community.

<i>The simpler definition would be</i>: <br />
A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.

So basically a Hacker is the one who do Hacking? Mind-blown? Haha <br /><br />


## What do i need to learn & know??: <br />

1. <b><i>:computer: Basic Computer Skills:</i></b> <br />

It probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some basic computer skills. These skills go beyond the ability to create a Word document or cruise the Internet. You need to be able to use the command line in Windows, edit the registry, and set up your networking parameters. <br />

Many of these basic skills can be acquired in a basic computer skills course like A+. <br />
- Security Concepts & Technologies <br />
- Wireless Technologies <br />
- Scripting <br />
- Web applications ...etc <br /> 

2. <b><i>:satellite: Networking Skills:</i></b> <br />

You need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following. <br />

- DHCP <br />
- NAT <br />
- Subnetting <br />
- IPv4 <br />
- IPv6 <br />
- Public v Private IP <br />
- DNS <br />
- Routers and switches <br />
- VLANs <br />
- OSI model <br />
- MAC addressing<br />
- ARP <br />
- Advanced TCP/IP <br />

As we are often exploiting these technologies, the better you understand how they work, the more successful you will be. Note that I did not write the two guides below, but they are very informative and cover some of the networking basics mentioned above. <br />

3. <b><i>:hammer: Linux Skills:</i></b> <br />

it is extremely critical to develop Linux skills to become a hacker. Nearly all the tools we use as a hacker are developed for Linux and Linux gives us capabilities that we don't have using Windows. <br />

If you need to improve your Linux skills, or you're just getting started with Linux, check out Null-Byte series for beginners below.

4. <b><i>:lock: Cryptography:</i></b> <br />

Although one doesn't need to be a cryptographer to be a good hacker, the more you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each cryptographic algorithm, the better the chances of defeating it. In addition, cryptography can used by the hacker to hide their activities and evade detection.<br />

5. <b><i>:eyeglasses: Reverse Engineering: </i></b> <br />

Reverse engineering enables you to open a piece of malware and re-build it with additional features and capabilities. Just like in software engineering, no one builds a new application from scratch. Nearly every new exploit or malware uses components from other existing malware. <br />

6. <b><i>:cyclone: Other needed Skills: </i></b> <br />

- Persistence: <br />
A hacker must be persistent. If you fail at first, try again. If that fails, come up with a new approach and try again. It is only with a persistence that you will be able to hack the most secured systems. <br />

- Curious: <br />
A hacker must be curious to look for things, and Wonder how things happen and created. Hackers are driven by their curiosity. <br />

- Creative thinker: <br />
There is ALWAYS a way to hack a system and many ways to accomplish it. A good hacker can think creatively of multiple approaches to the same hack. <br />

- Good problem Solver <br />
A hacker is always coming up against seemingly unsolvable problems. This requires that the hacker be accustomed to thinking analytically and solving problems. This often demands that the hacker diagnose accurately what is wrong and then break the problem down into separate components. This is one of those abilities that comes with many hours of practice.<br />
