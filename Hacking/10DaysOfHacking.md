# :skull: What is hacking?, How to learn How to hack? What should I learn? From where? <br /> <br />

Welcome buddy, I'm gonna walk you through a smaller version of the world of Hacking. <br />
I will give you some Resources to learn from (Docs, Videos, Articles...etc) <br />
<b> <i> One thing to put in mind! </i> </b>: <br />
- There's no ultimate map or road to follow. A lot of Hackers started from different Points and went through different road to get 
to one Goal which is Becoming a <i>Hacker.</i>
